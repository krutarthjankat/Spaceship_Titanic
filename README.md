# 🚀 Spaceship Titanic - Machine Learning Project

Welcome to the **Spaceship Titanic** repository! This project applies machine learning to predict passenger survival in a fictional interstellar disaster scenario, inspired by the Kaggle competition.

This project is part of an **ongoing Kaggle competition**, where participants aim to develop the best predictive model for determining whether a passenger was transported to another dimension.

The machine learning model achieved an accuracy of 80.3%, highlighting the strength of feature engineering, preprocessing techniques, and model optimization strategies.

## 📌 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to classify whether a passenger was transported to another dimension based on various features such as age, cabin type, and spending habits on the spaceship.
